===================

Aliyun ECS (Elastic Compute Service) Java SDK

Aliyun_ecs_java_sdk is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Aliyun_ecs_java_sdk provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Aliyun_ecs_java_sdk is simple, can be used with any programming language, [is used by many companies](https://github.com/kloudkl/aliyun_ecs_java_sdk/wiki/Powered-By), and is a lot of fun to use!

The [Rationale page](https://github.com/kloudkl/aliyun_ecs_java_sdk/wiki/Rationale) on the wiki explains what Aliyun_ecs_java_sdk is and why it was built. [This presentation](http://vimeo.com/40972420) is also a good introduction to the project.

Aliyun_ecs_java_sdk has a website at [aliyun_ecs_java_sdk-project.net](http://aliyun_ecs_java_sdk-project.net). Follow [@aliyun_ecs_java_sdkprocessor](https://twitter.com/aliyun_ecs_java_sdkprocessor) on Twitter for updates on the project.
